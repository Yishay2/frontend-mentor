## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to apply more advanced Tailwind CSS utility classes to improve design consistency and responsiveness. I also improved my component-based architecture in React.

Here's a small snippet I'm proud of:

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700 transition">
  Toggle Extension
</button>
Continued development
In future projects, I plan to:

Implement more robust filtering and sorting features

Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and better keyboard navigation

Add tests using Jest and React Testing Library

Useful resources
Tailwind CSS Documentation – Excellent resource for understanding Tailwind’s full potential.

React Docs – Helped me review component structure.

Frontend Mentor Discord – Great place to get feedback.
